This is one of the assignments in course MSCI 718 (Statistical Methods for Data Analytics) at University of Waterloo.  
This assignment employs R data visualization package ggplot2 to study on a built-in dataset in R ('Diamonds').
Findings and conclusions are given from two perspectives - pricing mechanism and purchasing behavior.  
Thank you to Mandy Chen and Yuchen Wang for helping me editing the report together.
