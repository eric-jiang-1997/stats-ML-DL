This is a modified assignment for course ECE 657A (Data & Knowledge Modeling & Analysis) at University of Waterloo. \
This project is done together by myself and Assal Nekoufar. \
The aim is to apply tree-based classifiers as well as Naive Bayes classifier to determine the status of positive COVID cases (Resolved / Not Resolved / Fatal), and compare the performance of various models.
